# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I chose common parts of a day like breakfast, coding, and breaks to simulate a productive day. I added some personality by including a gaming break and surprise event.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
The delay timing sometimes stacked in an odd way. It helped me realize how timing needs precise control in async JavaScript.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
Unlike regular scripts that run top-down instantly, async code can wait and respond in chunks. It simulates real-world delays and helps build smoother UI.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a surprise guest with random emojis and time, and a twist where the background color changes at the end of the day to simulate night.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
It's similar in the sequence but doesn't reflect interruptions well. Real-world events can overlap or change suddenly — something harder to simulate with basic timeouts.
